This bot is initially for my wife and I on a personal discord server but I may develop it for others if anyone else wants to use it


## Features

- Weather reports for my home city, including command for on-demand 3-hour report
- Youtube API usage to get personal project files and links
- Monster Hunter Now respawn time announcements
- Basic calendar event reporting with reminders (week, day, hour)
- Medication reminder for my specific time (midday) that pings 3-4 times over the course of a minute
- Energy spend reporting with yearly-spending command
